<p></p>
<p>
The report requires implementations to check the arguments of
procedures and subforms for syntactic forms for adherence to the
specification.  However, implementations are not required to detect
every violation of a specification.  Specifically, the report allows
the following exceptions:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some restrictions are undecidable.  Hence, checking is not
required, such as certain properties of procedures passed as
arguments, or properties of subexpressions, whose macro expansion
may not terminate.
</p>
<li><p>Checking that an argument is a list where doing so would be
impractical or expensive is not required.  Specifically, procedures that
invoke another procedure passed as an argument are not required to
check that a list remains a list after every invocation.
</p>
<li><p>With some procedures, future extensions to the arguments they
accept are explicitly allowed.
</p>
</ol><p>
The second item deserves special attention, as the specific decisions
made for the report are meant to enable &#8220;picky&#8221; implementations that
catch as many violations and unportable assumptions made by programs
as possible, while also enabling practical
implementations that execute programs quickly.</p>

<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_5.2">5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Safety</a></h2>
<p>R<sup>5</sup>RS describes many situations not specified in the report as &#8220;is
an error&#8221;: Portable R<sup>5</sup>RS programs cannot cause such situations, but
R<sup>5</sup>RS implementations are free to implement arbitrary behavior under this
umbrella.  Arbitrary behavior can include &#8220;crashing&#8221; the running program, or
somehow compromising the integrity of its execution model to result
in random behavior.  This situation stands in sharp contrast to the common assumption
that Scheme is a &#8220;safe&#8221; language, where each
violation of a restriction of the language standard or the
implementation would at least result in defined behavior (e.g.,
interrupting or aborting the program, or starting a debugger).</p>
<p>
To avoid the problems associated with this arbitrary behavior, all
libraries specified in the report must be safe, and they react to
detected violations of the specification by raising
an exception, which allows the program to detect and react
to the violation itself.</p>
<p>
The report allows implementations to provide &#8220;unsafe&#8221; libraries that
may compromise safety.</p>

<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_5.3">5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Proper tail recursion</a></h2>
<p>Intuitively, no space is needed for an active tail call, because the
continuation that is used in the tail call has the same semantics as the
continuation passed to the procedure containing the call.  Although an improper
implementation might use a new continuation in the call, a return
to this new continuation would be followed immediately by a return
to the continuation passed to the procedure.  A properly tail-recursive
implementation returns to that continuation directly.</p>
<p>
Proper tail recursion was one of the central ideas in Steele and
Sussman&#8217;s original version of Scheme.  Their first Scheme interpreter
implemented both functions and actors.  Control flow was expressed using
actors, which differed from functions in that they passed their results
on to another actor instead of returning to a caller.  In the terminology
of the report, each actor finished with a tail call to another actor.</p>
<p>
Steele and Sussman later observed that in their interpreter the code
for dealing with actors was identical to that for functions and thus
there was no need to include both in the language.</p>
<p>
While a proper tail recursion has been a cornerstone property of
Scheme since its inception, it is difficult to implement efficiently
on some architectures, specifically those compiling to higher-level
intermediate languages such as C or to certain virtual-machine
architectures such as JVM or CIL.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, abandoning proper tail recursion as a language property
and relegating it to optional optimizations would have far-reaching
consequences: Many programs written with the assumption of proper tail
recursion would no longer work.  Moreover, the lack of proper tail
recursion would prevent the natural expression of certain programming
styles such as Actors-style message-passing systems, self-replacing
servers, or automata written as mutually recursive procedures.
Furthermore, if they did not exist, special &#8220;loop&#8221; constructs would
have to be added to the language to compensate for the lack of a general
iteration construct.  Consequently, proper tail recursion remains an
essential aspect of the Scheme language.</p>
