<p>The <i>Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme</i>
(R<sup>6</sup>RS for short) is the sixth of the Revised Reports on Scheme.</p>
<p>
The first description of Scheme was written by Gerald Jay
Sussman and Guy Lewis Steele Jr. in
1975&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_39">39</a>].  A revised report by Steele and
Sussman&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_38">38</a>]
appeared in 1978 and described the evolution
of the language as its MIT implementation was upgraded to support an
innovative compiler&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_36">36</a>].  Three distinct projects began in
1981 and 1982 to use variants of Scheme for courses at MIT, Yale, and
Indiana University&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_27">27</a>,&nbsp;<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_25">25</a>,&nbsp;<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_12">12</a>].  An introductory
computer science textbook using Scheme was published in
1984&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_1">1</a>].  A number of textbooks describing and using Scheme
have been published since&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_8">8</a>].</p>
<p>
As Scheme became more widespread,
local dialects began to diverge until students and researchers
occasionally found it difficult to understand code written at other
sites.
Fifteen representatives of the major implementations of Scheme therefore
met in October 1984 to work toward a better and more widely accepted
standard for Scheme.
Participating in this workshop were Hal Abelson, Norman Adams, David
Bartley, Gary Brooks, William Clinger, Daniel Friedman, Robert Halstead,
Chris Hanson, Christopher Haynes, Eugene Kohlbecker, Don Oxley, Jonathan Rees,
Guillermo Rozas, Gerald Jay Sussman, and Mitchell Wand.
Their report&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_3">3</a>], edited by Will Clinger,
was published at MIT and Indiana University in the summer of 1985.
Further revision took place in the spring of 1986&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_4">4</a>] (edited
by Jonathan Rees and Will Clinger),
and in the spring of 1988&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_5">5</a>] (also edited by Will Clinger and
Jonathan Rees).  Another revision published in 1998, edited
by Richard Kelsey, Will Clinger and Jonathan Rees,
reflected further revisions agreed upon in a meeting at Xerox PARC in
June 1992&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_21">21</a>].</p>
<p>
Attendees of the Scheme Workshop in Pittsburgh in October 2002 formed
a Strategy Committee to discuss a process for producing new revisions
of the report.  The strategy committee drafted a charter for Scheme
standardization.  This charter, together with a process for selecting
editorial committees for producing new revisions of the report, was
confirmed by the attendees of the Scheme Workshop in Boston in
November 2003.  Subsequently, a Steering Committee according to the
charter was selected, consisting of Alan Bawden, Guy L. Steele Jr.,
and Mitch Wand.  An editors&#8217; committee charged with producing a new
revision of the report was
also formed at the end of 2003, consisting of Will Clinger,
R. Kent Dybvig, Marc Feeley, Matthew Flatt, Richard Kelsey, Manuel
Serrano, and Mike Sperber, with Marc Feeley acting as Editor-in-Chief.
Richard Kelsey resigned from the committee in April 2005, and was
replaced by Anton van Straaten.  
Marc Feeley and Manuel Serrano
resigned from the committee in January 2006.  Subsequently, the charter
was revised to reduce the size of the editors&#8217; committee to five and
to replace the office of Editor-in-Chief by a Chair and a Project
Editor&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_29">29</a>].  R. Kent Dybvig served as Chair, and
Mike Sperber served as Project Editor.  Will Clinger resigned from the
committee in May 2007.
Parts of the report were posted as Scheme Requests for Implementation
(SRFIs, see <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/">http://srfi.schemers.org/</a>)
and discussed by the community before being revised and finalized for
the report&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_14">14</a>,&nbsp;<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_2">2</a>,&nbsp;<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_6">6</a>,&nbsp;<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_13">13</a>,&nbsp;<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_9">9</a>].
Jacob Matthews and Robby
Findler wrote the operational semantics for the language core,
based on an earlier semantics for the language of the
&#8220;Revised<sup>5</sup> Report&#8221;&nbsp;[<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-31.html#node_bib_24">24</a>].</p>
