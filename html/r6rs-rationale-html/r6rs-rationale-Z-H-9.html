<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_chap_7">Libraries</a></h1>
<p>The design of the library system was a challenging process: Many
existing Scheme implementations offer &#8220;module systems&#8221;, but they
differ dramatically both in functionality and in the goals they
address.  The library system was designed with the primary
requirement of allowing programmers to write, distribute, and evolve
portable code.  A secondary requirement was to be able to separately
compile libraries in the sense that compiling a library requires only
having compiled its dependencies.  This entailed the following
corollary requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Composing libraries requires management of dependencies.
</p>
<li><p>Libraries from different sources may have name conflicts.
Consequently, name-space management is needed.
</p>
<li><p>Macro definitions appear in portable code, requiring that macro
bindings may be exported from libraries, with all the consequences
dictated by the referential-transparency property of hygienic
macros.
</p>
</ul><p>
The library system does not address the following goals, which were
considered during the design process:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>independent compilation
</p>
<li><p>mutually dependent libraries
</p>
<li><p>separation of library interface from library implementation
</p>
<li><p>local modules and local imports
</p>
</ul><p>
This section discusses some aspects of the design of the library
system that have been controversial.</p>
<p>

<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_7.1">7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Syntax</a></h2>
<p>A library definition is a single form, rather than a sequence of forms
where some forms are some kind of header and the remaining forms
contain the actual code.
It is not clear that a sequence of forms is more convenient than a
single form for processing and generation. Both syntactic choices have
technical merits and drawbacks. The single-form syntax chosen for
R<sup>6</sup>RS has the advantage of being self-delimiting.</p>
<p>
A difference between top-level programs and libraries is that a
program contains only one top-level program but multiple libraries.
Thus, delimiting the text for a library body will be a
common need (in streams of various kinds) that it is worth
standardizing the delimiters; parentheses are the obvious choice.</p>
<p>

<a name="node_sec_7.2"></a>
<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_7.2">7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Local import</a></h2>
<p></p>
<p>
Some Scheme implementations feature module systems that allow a
module&#8217;s bindings to be imported into a local environment.  While local
imports can be used to limit the scope of an import and thus lead to more
modular code and less need for the prefixing and renaming of imports,
the existence of local imports would mean that the set of libraries upon
which a library depends cannot be approximated as precisely from the
library header.
(The precise set of libraries used
cannot be determined even in the absense of local import,
because a library might be listed but its exports not used, and a library
not listed might still be imported at run time through the <tt>environment</tt> procedure.)
Leaving out local import for now does not preclude it from being added
later.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_7.3"></a>
<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_7.3">7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Local modules</a></h2>
<p>Some Scheme implementations feature local libraries and/or modules, e.g.,
libraries or modules that appear within top-level libraries or within
local bodies.
This feature allows libraries and top-level programs to be further
subdivided into modular subcomponents, but it also complicates the scoping
rules of the language.
Whereas the library system allows bindings to be transported only from one
library top level to another, local modules allow bindings to be
transported from one local scope to another, which complicates the rules
for determining where identifiers are bound.
Leaving out local libraries and modules for now does
not preclude them from being added later.</p>

<a name="node_sec_7.4"></a>
<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_7.4">7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Fixed <tt>import</tt> and <tt>export</tt> clauses</a></h2>
<p>The <tt>import</tt> and <tt>export</tt> clauses of the <tt>library</tt> form
are a fixed part of the library syntax.
This eliminates the need to specify in what language or language
version the clauses are written and simplifies the process of
approximating the set of libraries upon which a library depends, as
described in section&nbsp;<a href="#node_sec_7.2">7.2</a>.
A downside is that <tt>import</tt> and <tt>export</tt> clauses cannot
be abstracted, i.e., cannot be the products of macro calls.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_7.5"></a>
<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_7.5">7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantiation and initialization</a></h2>
<p>Opinions vary on how libraries should be instantiated and
initialized during the expansion and execution of library bodies,
whether library instances should be distinguished across phases,
and whether levels should be declared so that they constrain 
identifier uses to particular phases. This report therefore leaves
considerable latitude to implementations, while attempting to
provide enough guarantees to make portable libraries feasible.</p>
<p>
Note that, if each right-hand side of the keyword definition and keyword
binding forms appearing in a program is a <tt>syntax-rules</tt> or
<tt>identifier-syntax</tt> form, <tt>syntax-rules</tt> and <tt>identifier-syntax</tt>
forms do not appear in any other contexts, and no <tt>import</tt> form employs
<tt>for</tt> to override the default import phases, 
then the program does not depend on whether instances are
distinguished across phases, and the phase of an identifier&#8217;s use cannot
be inconsistent with the identifier&#8217;s level.
Moreover, the phase of an identifier&#8217;s use is never inconsistent with the
identifier&#8217;s level if the implementation uses an implicit phasing model in
which references are allowed at any phase regardless of any phase
declarations.</p>
<p>

<a name="node_sec_7.6"></a>
<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_7.6">7.6&nbsp;&nbsp;Immutable exports</a></h2>
<p>The asymmetry in the prohibitions against assignments to explicitly
and implicitly exported variables reflects the fact that the violation
can be determined for implicitly exported variables only when the
importing library is expanded.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_7.7"></a>
<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_7.7">7.7&nbsp;&nbsp;Compound library names</a></h2>
<p>Library names are compound.  This differs from the treatment of
identifiers in the rest of the language.  Using compound names
reflects experience across programming languages that a structured
top-level name space is necessary to avoid collisions.  Embedding a
hierarchy within a single string or symbol is certainly possible.
However, in Scheme, list data is the natural means for representing
hierarchical structure, rather than encoding it in a string or symbol.
The hierarchical structure makes it easy to formulate policies for
choosing unique names or possible storage formats in a file system.
See appendix&nbsp;on &#8220;Unique library
names&#8221;.
Consequently, despite the syntactic complexity of compound
names, and despite the potential mishandling of the hierarchy by
implementations, the editors chose the list representation.</p>

<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_7.8">7.8&nbsp;&nbsp;Versioning</a></h2>
<p>Libraries and <tt>import</tt> clauses optionally carry versioning
information.  This allows reflecting the development history of a
library, but also significantly increases the complexity of the
library system.  Experience with module systems gathered in other
languages as well as with shared libraries at the operating-system
level consistently indicates that relying only on the name of a module
for identification causes conflicts impossible to rectify in the
absence of versioning information, and thus diminishes the
opportunities for sharing code.  Therefore, versioning is part of the
library system.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_7.9"></a>
<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_7.9">7.9&nbsp;&nbsp;Treatment of different versions</a></h2>
<p>Implementations are encouraged to prohibit two
libraries with the same name but different versions to coexist
within the same program.
While this prevents the combination of libraries and
programs that require different versions of the same library,
it eliminates the potential for having multiple copies of a
library&#8217;s state, thus avoiding problems experienced with
other shared-library mechanisms,
including Windows DLLs and Unix shared objects.</p>
