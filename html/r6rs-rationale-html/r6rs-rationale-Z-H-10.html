<a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_chap_8">Top-level programs</a></h1>
<p>The notion of &#8220;top-level program&#8221; is new in R<sup>6</sup>RS and replaces the
notion of &#8220;Scheme program&#8221; in R<sup>5</sup>RS.  The two are quite different:
While a R<sup>6</sup>RS top-level program is defined to be a complete, textual
entity, an R<sup>5</sup>RS program can evolve by being entered piecemeal into
a running Scheme system.  Many Scheme systems have interactive
command-line environments based on the semantics of R<sup>5</sup>RS programs.
However, the specification of R<sup>5</sup>RS programs is not really
sufficient to describe how to operate an arbitrary Scheme system: The
R<sup>5</sup>RS is ambiguous on some aspects of the semantics such as binding.
Moreover, R<sup>5</sup>RS&#8217;s <tt>load</tt> procedure does say how to load source
code into the running system; the pragmatics of <tt>load</tt> would
often make compiling programs before execution problematic, in
particular with regard to macros.  Furthermore, Scheme implementations
handle treatment of and recovery from errors in different ways.</p>
<p>
Tightening the specification of programs from R<sup>5</sup>RS would have been
possible, but could have restricted the design employed by Scheme
implementations in undesirable ways.  Moreover, alternative approaches
to structuring the user interface of a Scheme implementation have
emerged since R<sup>5</sup>RS.  Consequently, R<sup>6</sup>RS makes no attempt at trying
to specify the semantics of programs as in R<sup>5</sup>RS; the design of an
interactive environment is now completely in the hands of the
implementors.  On the other hand, being able to distribute portable
programs is one of the goals of the R<sup>6</sup>RS process.  As a result, the
notion of top-level program was added to the report.</p>
<p>
By allowing the interleaving of definitions and expressions, top-level 
programs support exploratory and interactive development, without 
imposing unnecessary organizational overhead on code that might not be 
intended for reuse.</p>
