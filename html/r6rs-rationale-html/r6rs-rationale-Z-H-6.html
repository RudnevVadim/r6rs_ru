<h3 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_4.1.1">4.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Escaped symbol constituents</a></h3>
<p>While revising the syntax of symbols and identifiers, the editors&#8217;
goal was to make symbols subject to write/read invariance, i.e. to
allow each symbol to be written out using <tt>put-datum</tt> (section
on &#8220;Textual output&#8221;) or <tt>write</tt>
(section&nbsp;on &#8220;Simple I/O&#8221;), and
read back in using <tt>get-datum</tt> (section
on &#8220;Textual input&#8221;) or
<tt>read</tt> (section on &#8220;Simple I/O&#8221;), yielding the same symbol.  This
was not the case in <i>Revised<sup>5</sup> Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme</i>, as symbols could contain arbitrary
characters such as spaces which could not be part of their external
representation.  Moreover, symbols could be distinguished internally by
case, whereas their external representation could not.</p>
<p>
For representing unusual characters in the symbol syntax, the report
provides the <tt><tt>\</tt>x</tt> escape syntax, which allows an arbitrary
Unicode scalar value to be specified.  This also has the advantage that
arbitrary symbols can be represented using only ASCII, which allows
referencing them from Scheme programs restricted to ASCII or some
other subset of Unicode.</p>
<p>
Among existing implementations of Scheme, a popular choice for
extending the set of characters that can occur in symbols is the
vertical-bar syntax of Common Lisp.  The vertical-bar syntax of Common
Lisp carries the risk of confusing the syntax of identifiers with that
of consecutive lexemes, and also does not allow representing arbitrary
characters using only ASCII.  Consequently, it was not adopted for
R<sup>6</sup>RS.</p>

<h3 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_4.1.2">4.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Case sensitivity</a></h3>
<p></p>
<p>
The change from case-insensitive syntax in R<sup>5</sup>RS to case-sensitive
syntax is a major change.  Many technical arguments exist in favor of
both case sensitivity and case insensitivity, and any attempt to list
them all here would be incomplete.  
</p>
<p>
The editors decided to switch to case sensitivity, because they
perceived that a significant majority of the Scheme community favored
the change.  This perception has been strengthened by polls at the
2004 Scheme workshop, on the <tt>plt-scheme</tt> mailing list, and the
<tt>r6rs-discuss</tt> mailing list.</p>
<p>
The suggested directives described in
appendix&nbsp;on &#8220;Optional case
insensitivity&#8221; allow programs to specify that a section of the code (or other
syntactic data) was written under the old assumption of
case-insensitivity and therefore must be case-folded upon reading.</p>

<h3 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_4.1.3">4.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifiers starting with <tt>-&gt;</tt></a></h3>
<p>R<sup>6</sup>RS introduces a special rule in the lexical syntax for
identifiers starting with the characters <tt>-&gt;</tt>.  In R<sup>5</sup>RS, such
identifiers are not valid lexemes.  (In R<sup>5</sup>RS, a lexeme starting
with a <tt>-</tt> character&#8212;except for <tt>-</tt> itself&#8212;must be a
representation of a number object.)
However, many existing
Scheme implementations prior to R<sup>6</sup>RS already supported identifiers
starting with <tt>-&gt;</tt>.  (Many readers would classify any lexeme as an
identifier starting with <tt>-</tt> for which <tt>string-&gt;number</tt>
returns <tt>#f</tt>.)  As a result, a significant amount of otherwise
portable Scheme code used identifiers starting with <tt>-&gt;</tt>, which
are a convenient choice for certain names.  Therefore, R<sup>6</sup>RS legalizes
these identifiers.  The separate production in the grammar is not particularly elegant.
However, designing a more elegant production that does not overlap with
representations of number objects or other lexeme classes has proven to be surprisingly
difficult.</p>

<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_4.2">4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments</a></h2>
<p>While R<sup>5</sup>RS provides only the <tt>;</tt> syntax for comments, the report
now describes three comment forms: In addition to <tt>;</tt>, <tt>#|</tt>
and <tt>|#</tt> delimit block comments, and <tt><tt>#</tt>;</tt> starts a
&#8220;datum comment&#8221;.  (<tt><tt>#</tt>!r6rs</tt> is also a kind of comment,
albeit with a specific, fixed purpose.) </p>
<p>
Block comments provide a convenient way of writing multi-line
comments, and are an often-requested and often-implemented syntactic
addition to the language. </p>
<p>
A datum comment always comments out a single datum&#8212;no more, and no less,
something the other comment forms cannot reliably do.
Their uses include commenting out alternative versions of a form and
commenting out forms that may be required only in certain circumstances.
Datum comments are perhaps most useful during development and debugging
and may thus be less likely to appear in the final version of a
distributed library or top-level program; even so, a programmer or group
of programmers sometimes develop and debug a single piece of code
concurrently on multiple systems, in which case a standard notation for
commenting out a datum is useful.</p>

<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_4.3">4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Future extensions</a></h2>
<p>The <tt><tt>#</tt></tt> is the prefix of several different kinds of
syntactic entities: vectors, bytevectors, syntactic abbreviations related
to syntax construction, nested comments, characters,
<tt><tt>#</tt>!r6rs</tt>, and implementation-specific extensions to the
syntax that start with <tt><tt>#</tt>!</tt>.  In each case, the character
following the <tt><tt>#</tt></tt> specifies what kind of syntactic datum follows.
In the case of bytevectors, the syntax anticipates several different
kinds of homogeneous vectors, even though R<sup>6</sup>RS specifies only
one. The <tt>u8</tt> after the <tt><tt>#</tt>v</tt> identifies the
components of the vector as unsigned 8-bit entities or octets.</p>
