This document describes rationales for some of the design decisions
behind the <i>Revised<sup>6</sup> Report on the Algorithmic Language
Scheme</i>.  The focus is on changes made since the last revision on
the report.  Moreover, numerous fundamental design decisions of Scheme
are explained.  This report also contains some historical notes.
The formal comments submitted for drafts of the report and their
responses, as archived on <a href="http://www.r6rs.org/">http://www.r6rs.org/</a>, provides additional
background information on many decisions that are reflected
in the report.</p>
<p>
This document is not intended to be an exhaustive
justification for every decision and design aspect of the report.
Instead, it provides information about some of the issues
considered by the editors&#8217; committee when decisions were made, as
background information and as guidelines for future decision makers.
As such, the rationales given here may not be convincing to
every reader, but they convinced the editors at the time the
respective decisions were made.</p>
<p>
