<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_18.1">18.1&nbsp;&nbsp;Syntactic layer</a></h2>
<p>While the syntactic layer can be expressed portably in terms of the
procedural layer, standardizing a particular surface syntax
facilitates communication via code.</p>
<p>
Moreover, the syntactic layer is designed to allow expansion-time
determination of record characteristics, including field offsets, so that,
for example, record accesses can be reduced to simple memory indirects
without flow analyses or any other nontrivial compiler support. 
(This property may be lost if the <tt>parent-rtd</tt> clause is present, and
the parent is thus not generally known until run time.)
Thus, the syntactic layer facilitates the development of efficient
portable libraries that define and use record types and can serve as a
basis for other syntactic record definition constructs. </p>

<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_18.2">18.2&nbsp;&nbsp;Positional access and field names</a></h2>
<p>The record and field names passed to <tt>make-record-type-descriptor</tt>
and appearing in the syntactic layer are for informational purposes
only, e.g., for printers and debuggers.  In particular, the accessor
and mutator creation routines do not use names, but rather field
indices, to identify fields.
Thus, field names are not required to be distinct in the procedural or
syntactic layers.  This relieves macros and other code generators from
the need to generate distinct names.</p>
<p>
Moreover, not requiring distinctness prevents naming conflicts that
occur when a field in a base type is renamed such that it is the same
as in an extension Also, the record and field names are used in the
syntactic layer for the generation of accessor and mutator names, and
thus duplicate field names may lead to accessor and mutator naming
conflicts.</p>

<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_18.3">18.3&nbsp;&nbsp;Lack of multiple inheritance</a></h2>
<p>Multiple inheritance was considered but omitted from the records
facility, as it raises a number of semantic issues such as sharing
among common parent types.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_18.4"></a>
<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_18.4">18.4&nbsp;&nbsp;Constructor mechanism</a></h2>
<p>The constructor-descriptor mechanism is an infrastructure for
creating specialized constructors, rather than just creating default
constructors that accept the initial values of all the fields as
arguments. This infrastructure achieves full generality while leaving
each level of an inheritance hierarchy in control over its own fields
and allowing child record definitions to be abstracted away from the
actual number and contents of parent fields.</p>
<p>
The constructor mechanism allows the initial values of the fields to be specially
computed or to default to constant values. It also allows for
operations to be performed on or with the resulting record, such as
the registration of a record for finalization. Moreover, the
constructor-descriptor mechanism allows the creation of such
initializers in a modular manner, separating the initialization
concerns of the parent types from those of the extensions.</p>
<p>
</p>
<a name="node_sec_18.5"></a>
<h2 class=section><a href="r6rs-rationale-Z-H-2.html#node_toc_node_sec_18.5">18.5&nbsp;&nbsp;Sealed record types</a></h2>
<p>Record types may be sealed.  This feature allows enforcing abstraction
barriers, which is useful in itself, but also allows more efficient
compilation.</p>
<p>
In particular, when the implementor of an abstract data type chooses
to represent that ADT by a record type, and allows one of the record types
that represent the ADT to be exposed and extended, then the ADT is
no longer abstract.  Its implementors must expose enough information
to allow for effective subtyping, and must commit to enough of the
representation to allow those subtypes to continue to work even as
the ADT evolves.</p>
<p>
A partial solution is to maintain independence of the child record type
from the specific fields of the parent, particularly by specifying a
record constructor descriptor for the parent type that is independent of
its specific fields.
When this is deemed to be insufficient, the record type can be sealed,
thereby preventing the ADT from being subtyped.
(This does not completely eliminate the problem, however, since the ADT
may be extended implicitly, i.e., used as a delegate for some other type.)</p>
<p>
Moreover, making a record type sealed may prevent its accessors and
mutators from becoming polymorphic, which would make effective flow analysis and
optimization difficult.  This is particularly relevant for
Scheme implementations that use records to implement some of Scheme&#8217;s
other primitive data types such as pairs.</p>
